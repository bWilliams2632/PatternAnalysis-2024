# 3D U-Net
## Model description
The 3D U-Net is an extension of the original 2D U-Net architecture which deals in 3D data instead.
The main focus is that the model performs voxel-wise segmentation where each voxel is assigned a class label.
This model is typically used in medical imaging to segment organs or identify tumors in MRI scans.
